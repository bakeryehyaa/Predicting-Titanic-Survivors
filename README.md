## 🚀 Features

- **Data Cleaning**  
  Handle missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Fare`. Drop unimportant columns like `Cabin`.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Binary encode `Sex`, and one-hot encode `Embarked`. *(Optional: extract titles from names.)*

- **Modeling**  
  Explore models like **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** to find the best performer.

- **Evaluation**  
  Assess models using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**.

- **Reproducibility**  
  Code is modular and reusable. Notebook and scripts provided. Predictions can be saved to CSV.
